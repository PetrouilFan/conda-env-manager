# Conda Environment Manager

A simple GUI tool to manage your Conda environments. If you're like me and constantly create environments for every new idea, only to forget about them until your storage runs out, this tool is for you. 

The **Conda Environment Manager** helps you:
- List all your Conda environments.
- Delete old or unused environments with ease.

I couldn't find an existing tool that worked exactly the way I wanted, so I created this. Even this README was AI-generated. Feel free to use, modify, or improve the code!

## Features
- **List environments**: Quickly see all existing Conda environments.
- **Delete environments**: Select and delete unused environments directly from the GUI.
- **Refresh list**: Keep the list updated after adding or removing environments.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Conda installed and added to your system's PATH.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conda-environment-manager.git
   cd conda-environment-manager
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```
4. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Future Plans
I might revisit this project next time I run out of storage. Until then, feel free to suggest changes or contribute!
